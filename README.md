before you start this code, make sure you install the requested library that is the "speedtest-cli". this code work in python and useful for those who want to know
the interned speed. you can also use the code in the terminal simply by just typing "speedtest-cli" but do not forget to install the packages first using the "pip install".
i recommend use the cmd instead of my code since it much simple to run (hahaha..). that's for the code. thank you by using it, peace !
